# jeudemots

Run:

```python
python3 jeu.py
```

Optionally:

```python
python3 jeu.py <board size> <number of teams> <language code>
```

where board size and number of teams are integers and language code is either 'fr' or 'en' (or some other if you add its words file).

It will generate two files: `public.png` and `secret.png`.
